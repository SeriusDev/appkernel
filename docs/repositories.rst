Repositories
============

The design of the repository API is influenced by peewee_, a nice and small python framework focusing on relational databases (sqlite, MySQL, PostgreSQL). The major
difference between peewee_ and the built-in **Appkernel** ORM is that the later is optimised (and till this time) implemented only for MongoDB. However, it is possible
to create your own implementation for SQL or any other database.

Basic CRUD (Created, Update, Delete) operations
-----------------------------------------------

.. note::
    You can follow all the examples in the Python's interactive interpreter using the imports and the configuration snippet from below.

The following example is only required for the interactive interpreter or for unit tests. In this case
we will use the MongoDB instance accessible on the **localhost** and will create a database called **tutorial**. ::

    from appkernel import AppKernelEngine, Model, MongoRepository, Property, content_hasher, create_uuid_generator, Email, AuditableRepository, NotEmpty, date_now_generator, Past
    from appkernel.configuration import config
    from pymongo import MongoClient
    from enum import Enum
    from datetime import datetime, date, timedelta
    from flask import Flask


    config.mongo_database=MongoClient(host='localhost')['tutorial']

For use in development or production you can choose between the following 2 options for configuration :

- use the built-in :ref:`default configuration`, where the Mongo database must be available on `localhost` and the database name will be **app**;
- or use the built-in :ref:`file based configuration` management to provide more fine grained configuration;

Default configuration
.....................
Once the :class:`AppKernelEngine` is initialised with no specific configuration and the **enable_defaults** parameter set to `True`, sensible
defaults are used (localhost and **app** as database). ::

    app_id='demo'
    app = Flask(app_id)
    kernel = AppKernelEngine(app_id, app=app, enable_defaults=True)

File based configuration
........................

Upon initialisation **Appkernel** looks for a file *../cfg.yml*, where the following parameters define a specific database connection: ::

    appkernel:
      mongo:
        host: localhost
        db: appkernel

The **host** variable may contain the user and password parameters using the *mongodb://* url schema.

Building a base model structure
...............................

Let's create a simple project management app with some tasks in it: ::

    class Priority(Enum):
        HIGH = 1
        MEDIUM = 2
        LOW = 3

    class Task(Model, MongoRepository):
        name = Property(str, required=True, validators=[NotEmpty])
        description = Property(str, validators=[NotEmpty])
        completed = Property(bool, required=True, default_value=False)
        created = Property(datetime, required=True, generator=date_now_generator)
        closed_date = Property(datetime, validators=[Past])
        priority = Property(Priority, required=True, default_value=Priority.MEDIUM)

        def complete(self):
            self.completed = True
            self.closed_date = datetime.now()

    class Project(Model, AuditableRepository):
        id = Property(str)
        name = Property(str, required=True, validators=[NotEmpty()])
        tasks = Property(list, sub_type=Task)
        created = Property(datetime, required=True, generator=date_now_generator)


Saving and updating
...................

Now we are ready to define our first **Project** with some **Tasks** in it: ::

    project = Project(name='some test project')
    project.append_to(tasks=Task(name='finish the documentation', priority=Priority.HIGH))
    # or if you like one-liners, you can add multiple tasks at once
    project.append_to(tasks=[Task(name='finish all todos'), Task(name='complete the unit tests')])

    project.save()
    print(project.dumps(pretty_print=True))

And the output looks sleek: ::

    {
        "id": "OBJ_5b142be00df7a9647023f0b1",
        "created": "2018-06-03T19:54:06.830307",
        "name": "some test project",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "completed": false,
                "created": "2018-06-03T19:53:38.149125",
                "name": "finish the documentation",
                "priority": "MEDIUM"
            },
            {
                "completed": false,
                "created": "2018-06-03T19:53:51.041349",
                "name": "finish all todos",
                "priority": "MEDIUM"
            },
            {
                "completed": false,
                "created": "2018-06-03T19:53:51.041380",
                "name": "complete the unit tests",
                "priority": "MEDIUM"
            }
        ]
    }


Now let's complete the first task: ::

    project.tasks[0].complete()
    project.save()
    ObjectId('5b1ee7050df7a9087e0e8952')
    print(project.dumps(pretty_print=True))

Observe the property **completed** which now is set to True and the **closed_date** having the value of the invocation date of the **complete()** method: ::

    {
        "created": "2018-06-11T23:17:57.050000",
        "id": "OBJ_5b1ee7050df7a9087e0e8952",
        "inserted": "2018-06-11T23:17:57.050000",
        "name": "some test project",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "closed_date": "2018-06-11T23:19:39.345000",
                "completed": true,
                "created": "2018-06-11T23:17:57.050000",
                "name": "finish the documentation",
                "priority": "HIGH"
            },
            {
                "completed": false,
                "created": "2018-06-11T23:17:57.050000",
                "name": "finish all todos",
                "priority": "MEDIUM"
            },
            {
                "completed": false,
                "created": "2018-06-11T23:17:57.050000",
                "name": "complete the unit tests",
                "priority": "MEDIUM"
            }
        ],
        "updated": "2018-06-11T23:19:46.428000",
        "version": 2
    }


Auditable Repository
....................

You might have observed that there are a few extra fields, which we didn't defined on the model explicitly.
This is happening due to the **AuditableRepository** class we've used in the very beginning. This will bring a few additional features to the mix:

- *inserted*: the date and time when the object was inserted to the database;
- *updated*: the date and time when the object was updated for the last time;
- *version*: the number of updates on this class;

Of course we could have stayed with the simpler :class:`MongoRepository` in case we are not in need of the extra magic for auditing our data model.

Delete objects
..............

We can check the number of projects quickly: ::

    Project.count()
    1

Once we don't need the project anymore we can issue the **delete** command: ::

    project.delete()
    1

You can delete all projects at once: ::

    Project.delete_all()

Querying data
.............

Appkernel provides a simple abstraction over the native MongoDB queries, simplifying your job for most of the queries. The query expressions
can be provided as parameter to the:

* **find** method: returns a generator, which can be used to iterate over the result set;
* **find_one** method: returns the first hit or None, if nothing matches the query criteria;
* **where** method: returns the :class:`Query` object, which allows the chaining of further expressions, such as **sort**;

A simple example: ::

    prj = Project.find_one(Project.name == 'some test project')
    print(prj.dumps(pretty_print=True))

Or use property name chaining for searching all project which contain the word 'finish' in their task description: ::

    prj = Project.find_one(Project.tasks.name % 'finish')
    print(prj.dumps(pretty_print=True))

An alternative way to achieve the same target: ::

    prj2 = Project.find_one(Project.tasks[Task.name == 'finish the documentation'])

Or you can iterate through all occurrences... ::

    for project in Project.find():
        print(project)

Or iterate through the ones which fit a query condition: ::

    for prj in Project.find(Project.name == 'some test project'):
        print(prj.dumps(pretty_print=True))

... and sort the result in a particular order: ::

    query = Project.where(Project.name == 'some test project').sort_by(Project.created.asc())
    for prj in query.find():
        print(prj.dumps(pretty_print=True))

Adding multiple expressions to the query is also straightforward: ::

    yesterday = datetime.combine(date(2018, 6, 10), datetime.min.time())
    today = datetime.combine(date(2018, 6, 11), datetime.min.time())
    prj = Project.find_one((Project.created > yesterday) & (Project.created < today))
    print(prj.dumps(pretty_print=True))

Pagination
..........

Sometimes it is a good approach to define a range (a page) which is gonna be queried, in this way we avoid filling up the memory with a huge result set.
The following query will return the first 10 Projects from the database: ::

    for prj in Project.find(page=0, page_size=10):
        print(prj)

Query expressions
.................

Find by ID
''''''''''

Find a project knowing its exact id: ::

    prj = Project.find_by_id('5b1ee9930df7a9087e0e8953')

Exact match
'''''''''''
Returns where the field `name` exactly matches: *'Project A'*: ::

    prj = Project.find_one((User.name == 'Project A'))

Not equal
'''''''''
Return all projects **except** *'Project A'*: ::

    prj = Project.find_one((User.name != 'Project A'))

Or
''
Returns *'Project A'* or *'Project B'*: ::

    prj = Project.find_one((Project.name == 'Project A') | (Project.name == 'Project B'))


And
'''
Returns every project named *'Project A'* created after yesterday: ::

    yesterday = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1))
    prj = Project.find_one((Project.name == 'Project A') & (Project.created > yesterday))

Empty Array
'''''''''''
Find all Projects with no tasks: ::

    prj = Project.find_one(Project.tasks == None)

Contains
''''''''
Find all projects which has at least one task containing the string 'finish': ::

    prj = Project.find_one(Project.tasks.name % 'finish')

Also you can query for values in an array. The following query will return all users, who are having the Role **Admin** and **Operator**: ::

    User.find(User.roles % ['Admin', 'Operator'])

Does not exists
'''''''''''''''

Return all users which have no defined **description** field: ::

    User.find(User.description == None)

Value exists (not None)
'''''''''''''''''''''''
Return all users which has description field: ::

    User.find(User.description != None)

Smaller and bigger
''''''''''''''''''
Return all projects created between a well defined period of time: ::

    yesterday = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1))
    tomorrow = (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1))
    user_iterator = Project.find((User.created > yesterday) & (User.created < tomorrow))

Query with custom properties
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Sometimes the object model does not contains a property but the field is available in the database. Think about the :ref:`AuditableRepository` which automatically
creates extra fields such as object version. In case we'd like to search all documents with version 2, the **custom property** comes handy: ::

    project = Project.find_one(Project.custom_property('version') == 2)


Native Queries
..............

Appkernel's built-in ORM tries to cover the common use-cases and it will be further developed in the future, however in case there's a need for special
and very complex query, we might want to fallback to MongoDB's native query. ::

    project.counter=5
    project.save()
    for p in Project.find_by_query({'counter': {'$gte': 0, '$lt': 10}}):
        print 'Project name: {} and counter: {}'.format(p.name, p.counter)

Alternatively you can also access a reference to a `PyMongo`_ :class:`Collection` object via the :class:`Model`'s **get_collection** method. ::

    mongo_document = Project.get_collection().find_one(filter)

For more details on what can you do via the collection reference, please consult the **pymongo** documentation.
.. _PyMongo: https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/

Bulk insert
...........

Sometimes you're in need to insert (upsert) multiple objects at once: ::

    def create_user_batch(urange=51):
    users = []
    for i in range(1, urange):
        users.append(User().update(name='multi_user_{}'.format(i)).update(password='some default password'). \
            append_to(roles=['Admin', 'User', 'Operator']).update(description='some description').update(
            sequence=i))
    return users
    ids = User.bulk_insert(create_user_batch()

Index management
----------------
In order to speed up lookup for certain fields, you might want to add indexes to certain properties. This can be easily achieved by using the **index** parameter of the :class:`Property` class.
Let's redefine the **Project** class: ::

    class Project(Model, AuditableRepository):
        ...
        name = Property(str, required=True, validators=[NotEmpty()], index=UniqueIndex)
        created = Property(datetime, required=True, generator=date_now_generator, index=Index)
        ...

    User.init_indexes()

Mind the `index=UniqueIndex` on the **name** property and the `index=Index` on the **created** property. The idea behind the Unique Index is to avoid
accidental project name duplication, while the normal Index on the created field will speed up the search and sorting by created date.

Built-in Indexes
................

- **Index**: used to speed up queries (also will slow insertion, so use it with care);
- **UniqueIndex**: will make sure that the value exists only once in the database;
- **TextIndex**: can be used all string fields and helps with full-text search;

For more information on indexes, please have look on Mongo_'s documentation;

.. _Mongo: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/

Schema Installation
-------------------
MongoDB started its life as a schema less database, however the advantages of applying a schema on a database was soon recognized by the Mongo folks.
Data integrity is assured by enforcing validation on inserts and udpates.

MongoDB now supports a subset of JSON Schema which can be used to validate field against type information or matching a regular expression or set of Enum values.
The Mongo Specific JSON schema can be generated by Appkernel's :class:`Model` and installed by the childs of :class:`MongoRepository`. ::

    Project.add_schema_validation(validation_action='error')

The validation_action can take the value:

- `error` - in case an object is not valid, the insertion will be rejected;
- `warning` - in case of a schema validation error, only a log-line is registered in MongoDB;

Supported Repository Types
--------------------------
All repositories are extending the :class:`Repository` base class. This class serves as an Interface (so a sort of an implementation guideline, since
the Interface concept is not supported by Python) for all other repository implementations.

- :class:`MongoRepository` - standard repository functionality providing access to MongoDB;
- :class:`AuditableRepository` - an extended repository, which will save the user, document creation date and some other, useful metadata information;

Advanced Functionality
----------------------

Accessing the  native **pymongo** :class:`collection` class opens a lot of new opportunities.

Dropping the collection
.......................

Will drop the complete collection: ::

    User.get_collection().drop()

Check index information
.......................

The index information can be retrieved: ::

    idx_info = User.get_collection().index_information()

... or alternatively: ::

    config.mongo_database['Users'].index_information()

Aggregation Pipeline
.....................
Mongo features a very powerful map-reduce tool called `Aggregation Pipeline`_, very useful for complicated queries: ::

    pipeline = [{'$match': ...}, {'$group': ...}]
    Project.get_collection().aggregate(pipeline)

.. _Aggregation Pipeline: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/aggregation/
